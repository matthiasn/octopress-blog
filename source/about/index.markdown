Hi there, I am **Matthias** and I am a **freelance** software engineer from Hamburg, Germany. I am currently mostly interested in Clojure and ClojureScript. When it comes to data visualization, I am particularly interested in data about **now**, with live updates. 

Please don't hesitate and send me an [email](mailto:matthias.nehlsen@gmail.com) if you have anything you want to talk about.
